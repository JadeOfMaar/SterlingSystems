	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.5
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Moved Batteries to their own folder and away from FuelCells.
			change = Set Sun shield's System Heat loop temperature to 700 K, respecting its high heat tolerance as an armor but staying near to low temp radiator territory.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed/Revised Upgrade parts. They show up in the tech tree now.
			change = Updated the balancing of all electrics.
			change = Updated the balancing of all thermals to hopefully fit Nertea's balance scheme.
			change = Updated tech progression.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.1
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed the System Heat Fission Engines module problem: Ensured that affected engines always hold the requested nuclear resource.
			change = Updated localization (fixes an issue in the B9PS patch for the fuel cells).
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.0
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added FusionPellets production to large ICF engine.
			change = Added Kerbalism configs. (Sun and Shadow shields can hold "Shielding" resource.)
			change = Added System Heat and Kerbalism System Heat configs for all radiators.
			change = Added System Heat configs for all current engines.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added Sun and Shadow shields.
			subchange = With detailed, fully localized tooltips and upgrades.
			subchange = Shadow shields contribute to System Heat loop volume.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Changes to metal fuel cells:
			subchange = Fully localized tooltips.
			subchange = Added Recharger information to tooltips, including precise System Heat information.
			subchange = Restored some ThermalPower output.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Changes to wrapper PVs:
			subchange = Fully localized tooltips.
			subchange = Updated upgrades information.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Added cost of EnrU to engines that hold it.
			change = Changed SULEU engines to surface attach from their top, not their side.
			change = Reduced amounts of EnrU held by GCNTRs.
			change = Updated balancing and tankage on fissile salt and fissile pebbles. Reactors should now hold 10 kerbal years worth of fuel by default and cost a lot more because the fuel is now more expensive.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.2.2
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added SULEU (NERV alternative) engines.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Localization for fuel cell B9 configs (partial) and resources.
			change = Finished remaining mesh work on batteries/fuel cells for Simple Repaint.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Updated fuel cell configs:
			subchange = Added Beryllium option.
			subchange = Updated stored amounts (B9 tank types) and ratios.
			subchange = Changed ThermalPower output to zero.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed mesh problem with 3.75m wrapper solar panels.
			change = Updated thermal efficiency curve of Delta Electro TBCs to fix zero efficiency bug when spawned with VesselMover.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.2.1
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Renamed wrapper solar panels and wrapper radiators. <b>This will break craft files!</b>
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Waterfall detection. <b>StockWaterfallEffects</b> is the particular plume pack needed.
			change = Added missing localization, and B9 switching and System Heat config for wrapper solar panels.
			change = Added missing System Heat config for 1.875m wrapper radiators.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.2
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Initial release.
