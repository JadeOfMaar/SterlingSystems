	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.8
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added stackable liquid film radiators.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added World Power parts:
			subchange = Solar Thermal Panel
			subchange = Solar Thermal Tower
			subchange = Air-breathing radiator suite
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Changes
			change = Adjusted volume calculation for inline heatsinks. The larger ones get a bit more loop volume.
			change = Buffed thrust on BCAM engine (Undid excessive nerf). Note: Liquid film radiators are not sufficient for it.
			change = Raised some engines' loop temperature since the liquid film radiators now exist and can cover their great needs.
			change = Changed Olympian and Icarus ICF engines to be single-mode.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fixes
			change = Fixed Icarus engine's System Heat engine module and converter module using the same heat loop.
			change = Fixed possible missing/incomplete KerbalismSystemHeat patches.
			change = Fixed tank shroud issue and antimatter issues with Sterling Tankage.
			change = Fixed turbine generators missing System Heat modules (resulting in -1% efficiency).
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.7.1
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Changes
			change = Tankage: Moved gas tank types to general liquid tank.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fixes
			change = Tankage: Added missing boiloff configs for Deuterium and Helium3.
			change = Tankage: Removed dependency on Rational Resources.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.7
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added tank suite with these diameters: 2.5m, 3.75m, 5m.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Changes
			change = Reduced added masses in Super Heavy shield.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed KerbalismSystemHeat problems.
			change = Ensured that all wrapper radiators' stock module stats still change when used with devices that still use/generate Core Heat when System Heat installed.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.6
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added World Power series parts: Giant vertical windmill and XXL solar panel.
			change = Added tiny solar panels.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Set Sun shield's System Heat loop temperature to 650 K.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed Thermal nozzle Waterfall plume problem. It needed an Ignition controller.
			change = Fixed Upgrades not showing in the CTT nodes.
			change = Updated Waterfall configs to respect engines being duplicated and altered by Rational Resources Nuclear Family.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.5
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Moved Batteries to their own folder and away from FuelCells.
			change = Set Sun shield's System Heat loop temperature to 700 K, respecting its high heat tolerance as an armor but staying near to low temp radiator territory.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed/Revised Upgrade parts. They show up in the tech tree now.
			change = Updated the balancing of all electrics.
			change = Updated the balancing of all thermals to hopefully fit Nertea's balance scheme.
			change = Updated tech progression.
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.1
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Fix
			change = Fixed the System Heat Fission Engines module problem: Ensured that affected engines always hold the requested nuclear resource.
			change = Updated localization (fixes an issue in the B9PS patch for the fuel cells).
		}
	}
	VERSION
	{
		version = 0.3.0
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added FusionPellets production to large ICF engine.
			change = Added Kerbalism configs. (Sun and Shadow shields can hold "Shielding" resource.)
			change = Added System Heat and Kerbalism System Heat configs for all radiators.
			change = Added System Heat configs for all current engines.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Add
			change = Added Sun and Shadow shields.
			subchange = With detailed, fully localized tooltips and upgrades.
			subchange = Shadow shields contribute to System Heat loop volume.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Changes to metal fuel cells:
			subchange = Fully localized tooltips.
			subchange = Added Recharger information to tooltips, including precise System Heat information.
			subchange = Restored some ThermalPower output.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Changes to wrapper PVs:
			subchange = Fully localized tooltips.
			subchange = Updated upgrades information.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			type = Change
			change = Added cost of EnrU to engines that hold it.
			change = Changed SULEU engines to surface attach from their top, not their side.
			change = Reduced amounts of EnrU held by GCNTRs.
			change = Updated balancing and tankage on fissile salt and fissile pebbles. Reactors should now hold 10 kerbal years worth of fuel by default and cost a lot more because the fuel is now more expensive.
		}
	}
