		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozram_title = Sterling TN-RJ 1.25m Thermal Ramjet Nozzle
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozram_desc = There is only so far that a chemical ramjet or scramjet can go before the inlet air temperature matches the exhaust temperature or the engine instantly melts. With our expertise of ceramics and thermodynamic flow control, it has become easy to swap the traditionally tiny combustion chamber for a honeycomb-like manifold providing dozens of such chambers and absorbing heat directly from a reactor. We can effectively achieve "runaway thrust" from just transonic speed and power through to nearly Mach 20.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozspike_title = Sterling TN-AS 1.25m Thermal Aerospike Nozzle
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozspike_desc = The mighty aerospike. It's none too great as an orbital engine but it excels in sea level and cross-range. The TN-AS series is mighty to perform even in the depths of a gas giant. Let us challenge the deep, once again!
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozturbo_title = Sterling TN-TJ 1.25m Thermal Turbojet Nozzle
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozturbo_desc = Since the advent of robotic and electric powered flight on Eve, or whatever other planet does not provide ambient Oxygen, kerbalkind has yearned for a means to realize ambitious levels thrust, efficiency and cruising speed, and above that, overcoming the need to refine, carry and combust something to power the fan. Rather than chemical or nuclear-electric, this nuclear-thermal turbofan induces rapid thermal expansion of air within its compressor stage for startup.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_scr01_title = Sterling J-S101 Scramjet Sleeve
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_scr01_desc = The beaten path through the Stratosphere is so laid by the prevalence of chemical rockets. The scramjet's simple engineering and relative efficiency strongly argues a different path, but unstable ignition, odd shapes and unbearable shock heating at the hypersonic aircraft's forward surfaces easily caused the scramjet to be sidelined for a lifetime... After which we have finally made it into a very attractive form which can bear extreme shock heating thanks to its experimental ceramic formula.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_scr02_title = Sterling J-S102 Scramjet Nacelle
		// #LOC_strl_eng_125_scr02_desc = The beaten path through the Stratosphere is so laid by the prevalence of chemical rockets. The scramjet's simple engineering and relative efficiency strongly argues a different path, but unstable ignition, odd shapes and unbearable shock heating at the hypersonic aircraft's forward surfaces easily caused the scramjet to be sidelined for a lifetime... After which we have finally made it into a very attractive form which can bear extreme shock heating thanks to its experimental ceramic formula.
		#LOC_strl_eng_062_thnozbell_title = Sterling TN-DL 0.625m Thermal Bell Nozzle
		#LOC_strl_eng_062_thnozbell_desc = Our new best friend, this vacuum-optimized DeLaval nozzle attaches to any compatible nuclear reactor and allows it to dump its heat immediately into any choice of propellant, granting much welcome superior impulse and immense thrust while reducing the amount of moving parts. It works well at sea level at home, too.
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozbell_title = Sterling TN-DL 1.25m Thermal Bell Nozzle
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozbell_desc = Our new best friend, this vacuum-optimized DeLaval nozzle attaches to any compatible nuclear reactor and allows it to dump its heat immediately into any choice of propellant, granting much welcome superior impulse and immense thrust while reducing the amount of moving parts. It works well at sea level at home, too.
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_thnozbell_title = Sterling TN-DL 2.5m Thermal Bell Nozzle
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_thnozbell_desc = This mighty DeLaval nozzle was prepared in advance for vessels that need less to lift their weight in atmosphere but to lift their weight in the void. The throat diameter is the same as the smaller engine so this engine is less thrusty and has better expansion for its size.
		
		// IPV
		#LOC_strl_eng_062_SULEU_title = Sterling IPE-NV "SULEU" 0.625m
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_SULEU_title = Sterling IPE-NV "SULEU" 1.25m
		#LOC_strl_eng_187_SULEU_title = Sterling IPE-NV "SULEU" 1.875m
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_SULEU_desc = In the shadow of a handful of fallouts involving High-Enrichment Uranium, scientists turned to testing the viability of Low-Enrichment Uranium within NERVA-derived engine bodies. Through a series of very interesting events, the Krussian RD-0140 concept engine became the leading model body, and it showed truly Superb Use of Low-Enrichment Uranium (SULEU), therefore its name.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_250_LSW_title = Sterling IPE-LS "Beryl Lion"
		// #LOC_strl_eng_250_LSW_desc = It's great to have easy access to what is nearly a torchship fuel, but not for long when it's radioactive, ready to explode, and stored everywhere. It was eventually found that we could have non-radioactive Lithium Salt and its non-radioactive exhaust but we still need to have an immense neutron source at the exhaust port, therefore, this SaltWater engine features a High Flux Isotope Reactor packed with Tritium.
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_MM_title = Sterling IPE-NP "MiniMag Orion"
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_MM_desc = This odd breed of engine sits at the peak of nuclear pulse technology. Why go to the trouble of making nuclear bombs and a bulky mass to catch the blast when the nuclear material can instead be forced into a fusion situation by wrapping it in a magnetic coil and using Z-Pinch dynamics to implode it? For its great impulse, TWR expectedly suffers, but its blasts are magnetically confined for maximum efficiency and allowing for a relatively small and very lean engine assembly, making it quite a prize to be sought by nuclear pulse connoiseurs.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_250_NSW_title = Sterling IPE-NS "Lime Fire"
		// #LOC_strl_eng_250_NSW_desc = Green is not only a popular color for things that give life...but also things that can take life, such as radioactives and acids. We decided to go out of our way to include a coloring agent in our Nuclear SaltWater to make the truly hazardous nature of this engine exceptionally clear. The use of this engine is therefore to be heavily restricted if not banned.
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_CCGC_title = Sterling IPE-GC "Slim"
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_CCGC_desc = Many good things are made in Kaina. It stood to reason that much of our staff would be Kainese too. We thought we'd do a great and welcome surprise for them by finding a very different shape for our nuclear lightbulb offering. This one is closed cycle and relatively safe. We expect everyone to use this one.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_375_FSZP_title = Sterling IPE-ZP "Zeptomere"
		// #LOC_strl_eng_375_FSZP_desc = Z-Pinch. The easiest breed of fusion engine that provides both great impulse and generous thrust, though, it's still a far cry from a fantasy thrust-hound breed like the Kerbstein or a certain aerospike. This engine is also rather lightweight as it produces magnetic confinement fusion without the involvement of large and heavy coils.
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_MCF_title = Sterling IPE-MC "Calabash"
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_MCF_desc = This deliberate, somewhat fruit-looking fusion rocket is the default choice of fusion rocket, inspired by the Discovery II project. The Calabash is a truly ripe main engine choice and engineering project by being capable of afterburning "gear-shifting" with its smaller chamber, possessing mechanical gimbal, and accepting diverse propellants. What's better than an engine that resembles something edible and can do all this??? ...Nothing.
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_OCGC_title = Sterling IPE-GC "Tiny"
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_OCGC_desc = Many good things are made in Kaina. It stood to reason that much of our staff would be Kainese too. We thought we'd do a great and welcome surprise for them by finding a very different shape for our nuclear lightbulb offering. This one is open cycle and its use is heavily restricted if not simply banned.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_375_PB_title = Sterling IPE-PB "Bapple"
		// #LOC_strl_eng_375_PB_desc = Between outgrowing solid core and treading into liquid core NTR, scientists realized that the reactor core's survivability, and operating temperature can be extended by having the nuclear fuel exist in the form of pebbles and forcing a centripetal propellant flow through the walls and between the pebbles. Long story short, the fuel can burn hotter and cool faster, making this engine the new champion of solid core design... One of our design reviewers kept intentionally mis-pronouncing the engine type and eventually it stuck. Blame that guy for the apple theme. Or thank him... Just don't ever assume we keep actual apples in or near this engine.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_1000_Orion_title = Sterling IPE-NP "Super Orion"
		// #LOC_strl_eng_1000_Orion_desc = 
		
		// ISV
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_AIM_title = Sterling ISME-AIM "Torchbearer"
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_AIM_desc = Antiproton-Initiated Microfusion. What a fancy term for "Sprinkle the normal fusion fuels with Antimatter to light them." The Torchbearer is so named for its role in being moderately thrusty and relatively very efficient versus other fusion rockets.
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_ASP_title = Sterling ISME-ASP "Kerblitzer"
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_ASP_desc = Artificial Singularity Power... A black hole engine. This is the Hawking radiation; thermal acceleration type and is modeled as a claw to visibly boast its Iron grip on something more terrifying than a burning star.
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_ICF_title = Sterling ISME-IC "Olympian"
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_ICF_desc = Per a natural flow of events and that much more investment into R&D, we were able to miniaturize the Icarus. For some reason, everyone celebrated this achievement by chanting "Don't talk to me or my son ever again!"
		
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_ICF_title = Sterling ISME-IC "Icarus"
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_ICF_desc = The legacy of the "Icarus" Inertial Confinement Fusion drive is extremely strong, even unavoidable, though many know it by its kindred's name, Daedalus. After 2 or 3 generations of R&D, this engine finally rises, much better and stronger than originally expected.
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_BCAM_title = Sterling ISME-BC "Immolator"
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_BCAM_desc = Beam Core AntiMatter. When AntiMatter becomes easy, the one and only thing to do is go all out. The sight of this engine when unlit will not fail to let observers know to be sure to look away while they still have functioning eyeballs.
		// #LOC_strl_eng_375_FFRE_title = Sterling ISME-FF "Nobelium"
