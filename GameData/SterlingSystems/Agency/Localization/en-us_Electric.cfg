		#LOC_strl_tectrb_desc = Behind every great source of heat there is a great turbine-based converter cranking out electricity. Raise the fuel priority on this part to help it to drain itself later or last.
		
		// Reactors KRUSTY
		#LOC_strl_rctrkrusty_title = Sterling KLUSTR
		#LOC_strl_rctrkrusty_desc = The Kerbal Low Uranium Stirling Topped Reactor meets the need for a fully integrated, small scale, always-on backup power source for operations on the moon and beyond.
		
		// Reactors SubCritical Multiplier
		#LOC_strl_rctrscm_title = Sterling Sub-Critical Multiplier Reactor
		#LOC_strl_rctrscm_desc = A nuclear reactor specifically intended to burn fast and push above its weight. Due to its use of a super-heavy fissile element like Curium-245, the element itself won't last long, and the reactor cannot be completely stopped so make use of it while it's there.

		#LOC_strl_fuelcell_desc = It never gets boring to watch an alkali metal violently react with a choice oxidizer... But we eventually realized that we could do very productive things with that energy, partially since we dunked too much of our Potassium. Now, with this Metal-Air Electrochemical Cell thing we can burn metal all we want and get stuff done. Since we can't directly observe the fireworks anymore we built in a pulsating light to fill in and keep ourselves entertained.

		#LOC_strl_fuelcell_cube_desc = How convenient is this? A KIS crate-sized metal fuel cell. It's great for small backup power but when fully loaded it becomes a serious back-breaker. Please do not try to equip this on EVA.
