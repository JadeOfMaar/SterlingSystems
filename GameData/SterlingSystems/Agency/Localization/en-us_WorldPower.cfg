		#LOC_strl-worldpower-wm1_title = Sterling World Power VAWT Type 1
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-wm1_desc = A vertical axis wind turbine designed to cluster easily and help to power a city.
		
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-pv1_title = Sterling World Power Photovoltaics Type 1
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-pv1_desc = A solar panel designed to cluster easily and help to power a city. This panel is upgrade-able and also becomes ineffective if overheated.
		
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-sth1_title = Sterling World Power Solar Furnace
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-sthxl_title = Sterling World Power Solar Tower
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-tcs1x_title = Sterling World Power Gulf Stream 1x TCS
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-tcs3x_title = Sterling World Power Gulf Stream 3x TCS
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-tcs6x_title = Sterling World Power Gulf Stream 6x TCS
		
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-sth1_desc = A concentrating solar panel with a small built-in thermal energy buffer and variable generator.
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-sthxl_desc = This solar thermal device consists of a very tall collector and a huge array of heliostats. It is the new gold standard for main power for landed settlements but includes no features for power conversion and handling of waste heat.
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-tcs_desc = An incredibly powerful radiator, the Gulf Stream series relies entirely on plumbing waste heat into an active stream of high pressure fluid. By consequence, it can only be used if the given celestial body has abundant atmosphere or a vast store of expendable water.
		
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-sth1-lowPower = The generator runs on boiling oil and works well at near-homeworld distances.
		#LOC_strl-worldpower-sth1-highPower = The generator runs on molten salt and works well at inner system distances.
