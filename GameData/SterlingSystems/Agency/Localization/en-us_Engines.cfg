		#LOC_strl_eng_062_thnozbell_title = Sterling TN-DL 0.625m Thermal Bell Nozzle
		#LOC_strl_eng_062_thnozbell_desc = Our new best friend, this vacuum-optimized DeLaval nozzle attaches to any compatible nuclear reactor and allows it to dump its heat immediately into any choice of propellant, granting much welcome superior impulse and immense thrust while reducing the amount of moving parts. It works well at sea level at home, too.
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozbell_title = Sterling TN-DL 1.25m Thermal Bell Nozzle
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_thnozbell_desc = Our new best friend, this vacuum-optimized DeLaval nozzle attaches to any compatible nuclear reactor and allows it to dump its heat immediately into any choice of propellant, granting much welcome superior impulse and immense thrust while reducing the amount of moving parts. It works well at sea level at home, too.
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_thnozbell_title = Sterling TN-DL 2.5m Thermal Bell Nozzle
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_thnozbell_desc = This mighty DeLaval nozzle was prepared in advance for vessels that need less to lift their weight in atmosphere but to lift their weight in the void. The throat diameter is the same as the smaller engine so this engine is less thrusty and has better expansion for its size.

		#LOC_strl_eng_062_SULEU_title = Sterling IPE-NV "SULEU" 0.625m
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_SULEU_title = Sterling IPE-NV "SULEU" 1.25m
		#LOC_strl_eng_187_SULEU_title = Sterling IPE-NV "SULEU" 1.875m
		#LOC_strl_eng_125_SULEU_desc = In the shadow of a handful of fallouts involving High-Enrichment Uranium, scientists turned to testing the viability of Low-Enrichment Uranium within NERVA-derived engine bodies. Through a series of very interesting events, the Krussian RD-0140 concept engine became the leading model body, and it showed truly Superb Use of Low-Enrichment Uranium (SULEU), therefore its name.
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_MM_title = Sterling IPE-NP "MiniMag Orion"
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_MM_desc = This odd breed of engine sits at the peak of nuclear pulse technology. Why go to the trouble of making nuclear bombs and a bulky mass to catch the blast when the nuclear material can instead be forced into a fusion situation by wrapping it in a magnetic coil and using Z-Pinch dynamics to implode it? For its great impulse, TWR expectedly suffers, but its blasts are magnetically confined for maximum efficiency and allowing for a relatively small and very lean engine assembly, making it quite a prize to be sought by nuclear pulse connoiseurs.
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_CCGC_title = Sterling IPE-GC "Slim"
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_CCGC_desc = Many good things are made in Kaina. It stood to reason that much of our staff would be Kainese too. We thought we'd do a great and welcome surprise for them by finding a very different shape for our nuclear lightbulb offering. This one is closed cycle and relatively safe. We expect everyone to use this one.
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_MCF_title = Sterling IPE-MC "Calabash"
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_MCF_desc = This deliberate, somewhat fruit-looking fusion rocket is the default choice of fusion rocket, inspired by the Discovery II project. The Calabash is a truly ripe main engine choice and engineering project by being capable of afterburning "gear-shifting" with its smaller chamber, possessing mechanical gimbal, and accepting diverse propellants. What's better than an engine that resembles something edible and can do all this??? ...Nothing.
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_OCGC_title = Sterling IPE-GC "Tiny"
		#LOC_strl_eng_375_OCGC_desc = Many good things are made in Kaina. It stood to reason that much of our staff would be Kainese too. We thought we'd do a great and welcome surprise for them by finding a very different shape for our nuclear lightbulb offering. This one is open cycle and its use is heavily restricted if not simply banned.
		
		// ISV
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_AIM_title = Sterling ISME-AIM "Torchbearer"
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_AIM_desc = Antiproton-Initiated Microfusion. What a fancy term for "Sprinkle the normal fusion fuels with Antimatter to light them." The Torchbearer is so named for its role in being moderately thrusty and relatively very efficient versus other fusion rockets.
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_ASP_title = Sterling ISME-ASP "Kerblitzer"
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_ASP_desc = Artificial Singularity Power... A black hole engine. This is the Hawking radiation; thermal acceleration type and is modeled as a claw to visibly boast its Iron grip on something more terrifying than a burning star.
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_ICF_title = Sterling ISME-IC "Olympian"
		#LOC_strl_eng_250_ICF_desc = Per a natural flow of events and that much more investment into R&D, we were able to miniaturize the Icarus. For some reason, everyone celebrated this achievement by chanting "Don't talk to me or my son ever again!"
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_ICF_title = Sterling ISME-IC "Icarus"
		#LOC_strl_eng_500_ICF_desc = The legacy of the "Icarus" Inertial Confinement Fusion drive is extremely strong, even unavoidable, though many know it by its kindred's name, Daedalus. After 2 or 3 generations of R&D, this engine finally rises, much better and stronger than originally expected.
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_BCAM_title = Sterling ISME-BC "Immolator"
		#LOC_strl_eng_1000_BCAM_desc = Beam Core AntiMatter. When AntiMatter becomes easy, the one and only thing to do is go all out. The sight of this engine when unlit will not fail to let observers know to be sure to look away while they still have functioning eyeballs.
